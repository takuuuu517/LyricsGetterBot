# TODO
- enable user to search artists/songs...
- show the results using quick reply
- show the lyrics using geniusLyrics


# problem...
- line bot does not allow to send more than 2000 letters at once
  - so if there are more than 2000 letters in lyrics it does not work
    - maybe divide the lyrics in half or something
